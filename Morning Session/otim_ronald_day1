# This line imports the CamelCase class from a library named 'camelcase'.
# If this library is not installed, you'll need to use `pip install camelcase` before running this code.
import camelcase

# This line creates an instance of the CamelCase class and assigns it to the variable 'c'.
c = camelcase.CamelCase()

# This line defines a string variable 'txt' and assigns the sentence "hello world" to it.
txt = "hello world"

# This line calls the 'hump' method of the 'c' object (which is an instance of CamelCase class).
# The 'hump' method likely converts the string in 'txt' to CamelCase format (e.g., helloWorld).
# The output of the 'hump' method is then printed to the console.
print(c.hump(txt))
